* [Baulari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaur) in Romanian folklore
* [Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU](https://eater.net/8bit)
* [Daniel Grie√ühaber's SAP-1](https://dangrie158.github.io/SAP-1/)
* The [Intel 8080 Microcomputer System User's Manual published September 1975](https://archive.ph/GFz3V)
* [Marco Schweighauser's Simple 8-Bit Assembler Simulator](https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/)
* The [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) and [PDP-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-12) minicomputers

## Coming next?
* Keyboard shortcuts
* New instruction set! (Hooray for breaking changes!)
* SOUND? (Probably not)
